## Objectives:

In response to Yulu's concern regarding the decline in revenues and the need to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market, our study aims to provide the following insights:
  1.	Identifying Significant Predictors
  2.	Understanding the Relationship Between Variables and Demand
Ultimately, our study will offer Yulu a data-driven understanding of the key factors affecting demand, and provide recommendations for leveraging these factors to optimize operations and improve revenue in the shared electric cycle market in India.
